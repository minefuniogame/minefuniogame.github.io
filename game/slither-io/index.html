<!-- About -->
<section id="about">
<h2>About Slither.io: The IO Phenomenon</h2>
<p><strong>Slither.io</strong> is the game that arguably defined the ".io" genre. Released in 2016 by Steve Howse, it took the classic "Snake" concept and injected it into a massive, multiplayer environment. It’s a <strong>timeless masterpiece</strong> of simple mechanics meeting high-stakes competition.</p>
<p>Unlike traditional snake games where you lose if you hit a wall or your own tail, in <strong>Slither.io</strong>, the only way to die is to run head-first into another player's body. This core mechanic creates a unique dynamic where a tiny, newly-spawned snake can successfully eliminate the largest player on the server through clever positioning.</p>
</section>
<!-- How to Play -->
<section id="how-to-play">
<h2>How to Play: Eat, Grow, and Survive</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
<p>The gameplay cycle is addictive and straightforward: Consume glowing orbs to get longer and thicker. Avoid hitting other snakes, and try to force them to hit your body instead.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Scattered across the map are multi-colored orbs. Some are stationary, while others are "floating" orbs that run away from you. The most valuable orbs come from the remains of a defeated snake. When a snake "pops," it leaves behind a massive trail of light that anyone can consume for rapid growth.</p>
<p><strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> Head-to-body contact is lethal. If your head touches another player's segment, you turn into orbs. If their head touches your segments, they turn into orbs. Size gives you a defensive advantage and more "surface area" to trap others, but speed and reflexes are what truly win battles.</p>
</div>
</section>
<!-- Objectives -->
<section id="objectives">
<h2>Objectives: Reaching the Top 10</h2>
<p>While Slither.io is an open-ended experience, players typically strive for three main goals:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Leaderboard:</strong> The top right corner displays the 10 largest snakes currently in your server instance. Getting your name on this list is the ultimate sign of dominance.</li>
<li><strong>Mass Accumulation:</strong> Your score is determined by your length. Reaching "Titan" status (over 20,000 mass) changes the way you play, as you become a massive obstacle for everyone else.</li>
<li><strong>Unlocking Skins:</strong> By sharing the game on social media or using special codes, you can unlock a vast library of skins, from country flags to vibrant patterns and even "invisible" or glowing designs.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<!-- Controls -->
<section id="controls">
<h2>Controls: Precision Movement &amp; Boosting</h2>
<p>Slither.io offers intuitive controls designed for both casual play and high-intensity maneuvers.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop Controls:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mouse Movement:</strong> Your snake follows your cursor perfectly. The closer your cursor is to the snake's head, the tighter the turn.</li>
<li><strong>Left Click or Spacebar:</strong> Hold to <strong>Boost</strong>. This increases your speed significantly but causes you to lose mass, leaving a trail of orbs behind you. Use it sparingly for attacking or escaping.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mobile Controls:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Joystick Mode:</strong> Use a virtual stick to steer.</li>
<li><strong>Arrow Mode:</strong> Tap and drag to point the snake.</li>
<li><strong>Double Tap:</strong> Hold the second tap to engage the boost.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Features -->
<section id="features">
<h2>Key Features: What Makes Slither.io Iconic?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Massive Multiplayer:</strong> Hundreds of players inhabit a single arena simultaneously, creating a living, breathing ecosystem of predators and prey.</li>
<li><strong>Equal Opportunity:</strong> A snake with 10 mass has the same killing potential as a snake with 50,000 mass. One wrong move by a giant can feed an entire army of small players.</li>
<li><strong>Customization:</strong> The skin builder and selection allow players to express themselves, making the arena a colorful kaleidoscope.</li>
<li><strong>Zero Barrier to Entry:</strong> No accounts required, no downloads, and no complex tutorials. You simply enter a nickname and play.</li>
</ul>

<section id="arena">
<h2>The Slither Arena: Navigating the Map</h2>
<p>The map is a giant circle. Understanding where you are is key to your survival strategy.</p>
<p><strong>The "Hot" Center:</strong> The middle of the map is where the largest snakes usually congregate and fight. It is high-risk, high-reward. Orbs are plentiful here due to frequent deaths, but survival is difficult.</p>
<p><strong>The Outer Rim:</strong> The edges of the map are much quieter. This is where players go to grow safely until they are large enough to compete in the center. However, if you hit the map's boundary, you die instantly.</p>
</section>
<!-- Strategies -->
<section id="strategies">
<h2>Advanced Strategies: The Art of the Kill</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Coil (The Wrap):</strong> Once you are long enough, find a smaller snake and begin circling them. Gradually tighten the circle until they have no choice but to hit your body. This is the most reliable way to secure mass.</li>
<li><strong>The Cut-Off:</strong> Use your boost to get ahead of another snake and suddenly turn 90 degrees in front of their path. This requires perfect timing and anticipation of their movement.</li>
<li><strong>Scavenging:</strong> Follow large snakes and wait for them to die or kill someone else. Stay on the outskirts of the fight and "vacuum up" the remains without engaging in the combat directly.</li>
<li><strong>The Bait:</strong> Pretend to be oblivious while a smaller snake tries to cut you off, then boost at the last second to turn the tables.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<!-- Tips -->
<section id="tips">
<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks: Survival of the Longest</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don't be greedy:</strong> When a large snake dies, don't rush into the middle of the mass pile. Usually, multiple snakes will collide there. Wait for the chaos to settle.</li>
<li><strong>Watch the mini-map:</strong> Use the map in the bottom right to see where the highest concentrations of players (and mass) are.</li>
<li><strong>Use your tail:</strong> Your tail is a safe zone. If you are threatened, turn back toward your own body. Since you can't die by hitting yourself, it creates a defensive barrier.</li>
<li><strong>Don't boost constantly:</strong> You are literally burning your score when you boost. Only use it when a kill is guaranteed or your life is at stake.</li>
</ul>

<!-- FAQ -->
<section id="faq">
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
<div class="faq">
<h3>1. How do I get more skins?</h3>
<p>On the main menu, look for "Change Skin." Some skins are unlocked by clicking the social media share buttons, but you don't actually have to post to unlock them!</p>
<h3>2. Why is the game lagging?</h3>
<p>Slither.io is resource-intensive. Try selecting "Low Quality" in the top right corner of the home screen or play in a "No-Lag" browser mode.</p>
<h3>3. Can I play with friends?</h3>
<p>There is no official "party" system, but you can try to join the same server by checking the IP address (using mods) or simply refreshing until your mini-maps look identical.</p>
<h3>4. What happens if I hit the edge?</h3>
<p>Hitting the circular border of the map results in instant death, regardless of your size. You do not leave orbs behind when you die this way.</p>
