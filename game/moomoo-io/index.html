        <!-- About -->
        <section id="about">
            <h2>About MooMoo.io: The Survival Sandbox Phenomenon</h2>
            <p>Developed by Sidney de Vries and released in 2016, <strong>MooMoo.io</strong> is a unique blend of survival mechanics and base-building strategy. Unlike pure combat .io games, MooMoo requires players to balance resource management with intense PvP (Player vs. Player) encounters.</p>
            <p>In this world, your primary objective is to <strong>generate gold</strong>. Gold is earned by placing windmills, which must be protected at all costs. As you gather wood and stone, you build a fortress to keep out raiders, all while competing with other players who want to tear your walls down and steal your spot on the leaderboard.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- How to Play -->
        <section id="how-to-play">
            <h2>How to Play: From Peasant to Fortress King</h2>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>The core loop of <strong>MooMoo.io</strong> involves three stages: Gathering, Leveling, and Defending.</p>
                <p><strong>Gathering:</strong> You start with a simple tool. Hit trees for wood, rocks for stone, and fruit bushes for food. These materials are essential for building your base and healing during combat.</p>
                <p><strong>Leveling:</strong> Every action you take earns you XP. When you level up, you advance through "Ages." Each Age allows you to choose new items, such as better weapons, specialized buildings, or advanced resource gatherers.</p>
                <p><strong>Gold Generation:</strong> To win, you must place Windmills. These generate gold over time. The more windmills you have, the higher your rank, but the larger the target on your back.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Resources -->
        <section id="resources">
            <h2>Resources: Wood, Stone, and Food</h2>
            <p>Understanding your inventory is the difference between life and death in the wilderness.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wood:</strong> Gathered from trees. Used for basic walls, spikes, and windmills.</li>
                <li><strong>Stone:</strong> Gathered from gray rocks. Used for advanced fortifications and specialized weapons.</li>
                <li><strong>Food (Fruit):</strong> Gathered from bushes. Essential for healing. Always keep a full stack of food in your hotbar to survive surprise attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Gold:</strong> Generated by windmills or gathered from rare gold rocks. Used to buy power-up hats and accessories in the shop.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Controls -->
        <section id="controls">
            <h2>Controls: Mastering Tools and Building</h2>
            <p>MooMoo.io requires quick switching between your weapon and your building materials.</p>

        <!-- The Age System -->
        <section id="ages">
            <h2>The Age System: Unlocking Powerful Gear</h2>
            <p>Progression is handled through the Age system. At specific XP milestones, you must choose your path:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Upgrade from a basic tool to a Sword, Axe, Polearm, or even a Great Hammer.</li>
                <li><strong>Ranged Options:</strong> Unlock Bows or Crossbows to harass enemies from a distance.</li>
                <li><strong>Buildings:</strong> Choose between standard Windmills or Faster Windmills; Wooden Walls or Stone Walls.</li>
                <li><strong>Specials:</strong> Unlock items like the Pit Trap (to freeze enemies in place) or Boost Pads for high-speed escapes.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Strategies -->
        <section id="strategies">
            <h2>Advanced Strategies: The "Pit Trap" and Baiting</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Pit Trap Combo:</strong> Place a pit trap and bait a player into walking over it. Once they are stuck, surround them with spikes. This is the most effective way to eliminate high-level players.</li>
                <li><strong>The Cookie/Pizza Heal:</strong> In the late game, upgrade your food to cookies or pizza. The healing per second is much higher, allowing you to tank through enemy attacks.</li>
                <li><strong>Corner Basing:</strong> Build your base in the corner of the map. This limits the number of directions enemies can attack from, making your defense 50% more effective.</li>
                <li><strong>Anti-Bull Strategy:</strong> If a player is using the "Bull Helmet," they deal high damage when hitting you. Use your own "Tank Gear" or "Spike Shield" to reflect that damage back at them.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Hats -->
        <section id="hats">
            <h2>The Shop: Using Hats for Combat Advantages</h2>
            <p>Hats aren't just cosmetic; they provide game-changing stats:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Miner Hat:</strong> Increases the amount of gold you get from rocks.</li>
                <li><strong>Bull Helmet:</strong> Increases your attack damage significantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Samurai Armor:</strong> Increases your defense and reduces damage taken.</li>
                <li><strong>Booster Hat:</strong> Increases your movement speed, perfect for chasing down low-health enemies.</li>
            </ul>
