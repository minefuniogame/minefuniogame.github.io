<section id="about">
<h2>About Venge.io: The Ultimate Browser FPS</h2>
<p><strong>Venge.io</strong> is a fast-paced, objective-based First-Person Shooter (FPS) that has taken the .io gaming world by storm. Unlike traditional shooters where you just run and gun, Venge combines sharp shooting mechanics with a unique card-based ability system.</p>
<p>Optimized for performance, Venge.io runs smoothly on almost any computer without requiring a download. Players compete in tight, competitive maps to capture objectives, earn "Spirit," and unlock special powers mid-match. It offers a highly competitive experience with a thriving community and leaderboard system.</p>
</section>
<!-- How to Play -->
<section id="how-to-play">
<h2>How to Play: Capture, Kill, Upgrade</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
<p>The core gameplay loop of <strong>Venge.io</strong> revolves around territory control and character progression within a match.</p>
<p><strong>Choose Your Loadout:</strong> Before spawning, select a weapon (Scar, Shotgun, Tec-9, or Sniper) and a Hero. Each weapon suits a different playstyle.</p>
<p><strong>Capture the Green Areas:</strong> You will see glowing green areas on the map. Standing inside these points captures them. Capturing points rewards you with "Spirit."</p>
<p><strong>Unlock Cards:</strong> As you gain Spirit (from kills and captures), you can unlock tiered cards. These cards grant abilities like throwing grenades, deploying turrets, or stunning enemies.</p>
</div>
</section>
<!-- Heroes -->
<section id="heroes">
<h2>The Heroes: Lilium, Shin, Echo &amp; Kulu</h2>
<p>Venge.io features distinct characters, each with their own look and specific ability cards:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lilium:</strong> The balanced fighter. Her abilities often focus on area denial, such as grenades and shockwaves.</li>
<li><strong>Shin:</strong> The speedster. Known for mobility and precision, Shin can use shurikens and movement boosts to flank enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Echo:</strong> The trickster. Echo can utilize grappling hooks and mobility axes to reach high ground instantly.</li>
<li><strong>Kulu:</strong> The tanky brawler. Great for holding down capture points and surviving sustained fire.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<!-- Controls -->
<section id="controls">
<h2>Controls: Movement and Combat</h2>
<p>Venge uses standard FPS controls but emphasizes fast movement and sliding.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WASD:</strong> Move character.</li>
<li><strong>Spacebar:</strong> Jump (Hold for Parkour/Climb).</li>
<li><strong>Shift:</strong> Crouch or Slide (while running).</li>
<li><strong>Left Click:</strong> Shoot.</li>
<li><strong>Right Click:</strong> Aim Down Sights (ADS).</li>
<li><strong>R Key:</strong> Reload weapon.</li>
<li><strong>E Key:</strong> Melee attack (Hammer/Axe).</li>
<li><strong>F Key:</strong> Throw Grenade / Use Ability.</li>
<li><strong>B Key:</strong> Buy/Upgrade Cards menu.</li>
<li><strong>Enter:</strong> Chat.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Card System -->
<section id="cards">
<h2>The Card System: Unlocking Abilities</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
<p>The defining feature of Venge.io is the <strong>Card System</strong>. It acts as a mini-MOBA mechanic inside an FPS.</p>
<p>When you accumulate enough score, you are presented with three random cards. These can be passive buffs (like faster reload or higher jump) or active abilities (like the Midnight Curse or Grenades). Choosing the right card for the current situation is often more important than raw aiming skill. Capture objectives to get these upgrades faster!</p>
</div>
</section>
<!-- Strategies -->
<section id="strategies">
<h2>Advanced Strategies: Maps and Movement</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Slide Jumping:</strong> Speed is life. By sprinting, pressing Shift to slide, and then jumping immediately, you can move faster than normal running. This makes you a harder target.</li>
<li><strong>Spawn Trapping:</strong> In maps like Sierra, knowing where enemies spawn allows you to predict their movement. However, spawn points rotate, so stay alert.</li>
<li><strong>Weapon Range:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shotgun:</strong> King of close range (Temple map).</li>
<li><strong>Scar:</strong> The best all-rounder for mid-range.</li>
<li><strong>Sniper:</strong> High risk, high reward. One-shot kills if you hit the head.</li>
<li><strong>Tec-9:</strong> Incredible fire rate for close-quarters "run and gun" styles.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Objective Baiting:</strong> Sometimes, leaving a capture point neutral attracts enemies. Wait for them to step on the green glow, then ambush them while they are distracted.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Safety Section -->
<section id="safety">
<h2>Is Venge.io Safe for Kids?</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
<p>Venge.io is a shooting game, but it is designed with a relatively mild aesthetic compared to realistic military shooters.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Violence:</strong> The game involves shooting other players. However, there is no gore, blood, or realistic injury. When players die, they simply disappear or ragdoll comically.</li>
<li><strong>Chat Interaction:</strong> The game features a public text chat. Like any online game, this can sometimes lead to toxic language. Parents are advised to monitor playtime or instruct children to ignore the chat.</li>
<li><strong>No Voice Chat:</strong> There is no built-in voice chat, which reduces the risk of inappropriate verbal interactions.</li>
<li><strong>Account System:</strong> Players can create accounts to save skins and stats, but the game can be played fully as a "Guest" without providing personal information.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> Suitable for teens and pre-teens (13+) comfortable with shooter mechanics. Younger children should be supervised due to the online nature of the game.</p>

<!-- Tips -->
<section id="tips">
<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks: Climbing the Leaderboard</h2>
<h3>Master the "Muscle Memory"</h3>
<p>Stick to one weapon initially (we recommend the Scar). Learning the recoil pattern of a single gun is better than being average with all four.</p>
<h3>Use Verticality</h3>
<p>Most maps in Venge have crates, walls, and ledges. Players rarely look up. If you can position yourself on high ground, you will win more gunfights.</p>
<h3>Don't Hoard Spirit</h3>
<p>As soon as you can unlock a card, do it. The advantage of a grenade or a damage boost is immediate and can snowball your lead.</p>

<!-- FAQ -->
<section id="faq">
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
<div class="faq">
<h3>1. Can I play Venge.io with a controller?</h3>
<p>Venge.io has partial controller support, but it is primarily designed for Mouse and Keyboard. You may need third-party software to map buttons effectively for a competitive experience.</p>
<h3>2. How do I get new skins?</h3>
<p>You can earn coins by playing matches and completing challenges. These coins can be used in the "Market" section to buy skins for your characters and weapons.</p>
