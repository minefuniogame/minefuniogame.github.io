<!-- About -->
<section id="about">
<h2>About Agar.io: The Big Bang of .io Games</h2>
<p>Released in April 2015 by developer Matheus Valadares, <strong>Agar.io</strong> is widely credited with starting the multiplayer ".io" game revolution. Set in a minimalist petri dish environment, you play as a single cell. Your mission is simple: consume smaller cells and pellets to grow larger while avoiding being eaten by the massive predators roaming the arena.</p>
<p>The game’s brilliance lies in its <strong>physics-based movement</strong> and the constant trade-off between size and speed. As you grow, you become more powerful but significantly slower, creating a unique balancing act where the "king of the hill" is always vulnerable to the agility of smaller players. Today, published by Miniclip, it remains a cornerstone of browser-based competitive gaming.</p>
</section>
<!-- How to Play -->
<section id="how-to-play">
<h2>How to Play: The Biological Warfare of Cells</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
<p>The core loop of <strong>Agar.io</strong> revolves around mass. You start as a tiny dot. To grow, you must hover over "agar" (stationary colored pellets) or other players smaller than yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Consumption:</strong> You can only eat another player if you are at least 10% larger than them. When you overlap a smaller cell, you absorb its mass instantly. However, as you gain mass, you experience <strong>passive decay</strong>—the larger you are, the faster you lose mass over time. This forces you to stay aggressive to maintain your ranking.</p>
<p><strong>Fragmentation:</strong> Survival isn't just about moving; it's about splitting. By launching half of your mass forward, you can catch faster prey or escape a closing trap. This creates the primary tactical layer of the game: determining exactly when to sacrifice your unity for a kill.</p>
</div>
</section>
<!-- Objectives -->
<section id="objectives">
<h2>Game Modes: FFA, Teams, and Experimental</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Free-For-All (FFA):</strong> The classic mode. No allies, no mercy. Every cell for themselves as you fight for the #1 spot on the leaderboard.</li>
<li><strong>Teams:</strong> Players are divided into Red, Blue, and Green teams. You cannot eat teammates, and the goal is for your color to occupy the majority of the map's total mass.</li>
<li><strong>Experimental:</strong> A playground for new mechanics. This mode often features unique "Mother Cells" that spawn pellets or different virus behaviors not found in the standard game.</li>
<li><strong>Battle Royale:</strong> A fast-paced mode where the map boundaries shrink over time, forcing players into a final, high-mass confrontation.</li>
<li><strong>Party Mode:</strong> Allows you to create a private link so you can play in the same server instance as your friends.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<!-- Controls -->
<section id="controls">
<h2>Controls: Mastering the Spacebar and W Key</h2>
<p>Agar.io uses a minimalist control scheme that is difficult to master but easy to learn.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mouse:</strong> Move your cursor to steer your cell. Your cell constantly moves toward the cursor.</li>
<li><strong>Spacebar:</strong> Split your cell in half. One half is launched forward at high speed. This is your primary attack.</li>
<li><strong>W Key:</strong> Eject a small amount of mass. This can be used to feed teammates, bait enemies, or "prime" a virus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mobile:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>On-screen Joystick:</strong> Drag to move your cell.</li>
<li><strong>Split/Feed Buttons:</strong> Dedicated buttons on the UI for splitting and ejecting mass.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Virus -->
<section id="virus">
<h2>The Virus: Your Best Friend and Worst Enemy</h2>
<p>The green, spiky circles scattered throughout the map are called <strong>Viruses</strong>. They are the great equalizers of Agar.io.</p>
<p>If your cell is smaller than the virus, you can hide inside it safely—larger players cannot follow you without hitting the spikes. However, if you are larger than the virus and touch it, your cell will <strong>explode</strong> into many tiny, vulnerable pieces. Skilled players use the <strong>W key</strong> to shoot mass into a virus; after 7 hits, the virus will "clone" and shoot a new spike at a nearby giant, shattering them instantly.</p>
</section>
<!-- Strategies -->
<section id="strategies">
<h2>Advanced Strategies: Split-Running and Baiting</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Split-Killing:</strong> If an enemy is less than 35% of your total size, you can split over them to consume them instantly. Timing this is crucial; if you miss, you're now in two smaller, more vulnerable pieces.</li>
<li><strong>The Corner Trap:</strong> Herd smaller players into the corners of the map. With nowhere to run, they are forced to either hit a virus or be consumed by your larger radius.</li>
<li><strong>Baiting with Mass:</strong> Eject a few "W" blobs to lure a greedy player toward a virus or toward your "mouth" just as you prepare to split.</li>
<li><strong>Anti-Team Awareness:</strong> The game has an "Anti-Teaming" mechanic in FFA mode. If you feed others or hit too many viruses in a short time, your mass decay rate will skyrocket. Learning to play solo effectively is the mark of a true pro.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<!-- Tips -->
<section id="tips">
<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks: How to Stay at the Top</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stay in 16 pieces:</strong> You cannot split into more than 16 pieces. Once you are at this limit, you can eat viruses without exploding, effectively "cleaning" the map for extra mass.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid the edges:</strong> While edges help corner others, they also limit your own escape routes. Stay in the open until you are large enough to dominate.</li>
<li><strong>Overlap merge:</strong> To rejoin your cells faster, move your cursor to the center of your fragments.</li>
<li><strong>Size vs Speed:</strong> Remember that small cells move faster. If a giant is chasing you, use your speed to weave through viruses.</li>
</ul>

<!-- FAQ -->
<section id="faq">
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
<div class="faq">
<h3>1. How do I get custom skins?</h3>
<p>You can unlock skins using coins earned through gameplay or by using specific usernames like "Doge," "Earth," "USA," or "Mars."</p>
<h3>2. Why am I losing mass so fast?</h3>
<p>All cells lose mass passively, but if it's exceptionally fast, you may have triggered the "Anti-Teaming" penalty by sharing too much mass with other players.</p>
<h3>3. What is the maximum size in Agar.io?</h3>
<p>While theoretical, most servers have a soft cap around 22,500 mass for a single cell, after which decay becomes almost impossible to overcome.</p>
<h3>4. Can I play Agar.io with no lag?</h3>
<p>Reducing your resolution in settings and disabling "Skins" or "Names" can significantly improve performance on slower connections.</p>
