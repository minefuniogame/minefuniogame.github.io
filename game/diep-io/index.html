<!-- About -->
<section id="about">
<h2>About Diep.io: The Evolution of Tank Warfare</h2>
<p>Created by Matheus Valadares in 2016 (the same developer behind Agar.io), <strong>Diep.io</strong> is a massive multiplayer online arena game that redefined the "growth" mechanic. Instead of just getting bigger, players evolve their tanks into specialized classes with unique abilities.</p>
<p>In this minimalist geometric world, you play as a circular tank. Your goal is to destroy colored shapes and enemy players to earn XP, which allows you to upgrade your stats and <strong>evolve into more powerful forms</strong> like Snipers, Destroyers, or Overlords. It is a game of skill, math-based builds, and bullet-hell reflexes.</p>
</section>
<!-- How to Play -->
<section id="how-to-play">
<h2>How to Play: From Basic Tank to War Machine</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
<p>Success in <strong>Diep.io</strong> depends on how you allocate your skill points and which evolution path you take.</p>
<p><strong>Farming:</strong> Shoot the yellow squares, red triangles, and blue pentagons scattered across the map. These are your primary source of XP in the early game.</p>
<p><strong>Upgrading:</strong> As you level up, you gain Stat Points (up to level 45). Use these to increase things like bullet damage, movement speed, or health. Every 15 levels, you can choose a new tank class.</p>
<p><strong>Survival:</strong> The arena is dangerous. Dodge incoming fire while positioning yourself to take out rivals. Remember: the leader of the arena is marked on the map for everyone to see!</p>
</div>
</section>
<!-- Attributes -->
<section id="stats">
<h2>Attribute Upgrades: Mastering Your Build</h2>
<p>Every time you level up, you can improve one of eight attributes. Balancing these is the key to a "build":</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Health Regen:</strong> How quickly you recover health after taking damage.</li>
<li><strong>Max Health:</strong> Increases the total amount of damage you can soak up.</li>
<li><strong>Body Damage:</strong> Damage dealt to enemies by physically bumping into them.</li>
<li><strong>Bullet Speed:</strong> How fast your projectiles travel across the screen.</li>
<li><strong>Bullet Penetration:</strong> How many objects or bullets your shot can pass through.</li>
<li><strong>Bullet Damage:</strong> The amount of health an enemy loses when hit by your shot.</li>
<li><strong>Reload:</strong> Increases your rate of fire.</li>
<li><strong>Movement Speed:</strong> How fast your tank moves around the arena.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<!-- Controls -->
<section id="controls">
<h2>Controls: Precision Aiming and Movement</h2>
<p>Diep.io offers a simple control scheme that allows for high-level tactical maneuvers.</p>
<p><strong>Desktop:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WASD / Arrow Keys:</strong> Move your tank.</li>
<li><strong>Mouse:</strong> Aim your turret.</li>
<li><strong>Left Click / Space:</strong> Fire your weapon.</li>
<li><strong>E Key:</strong> Toggle Auto-fire (fire continuously without clicking).</li>
<li><strong>C Key:</strong> Toggle Auto-spin (useful for certain builds like Octo-tank).</li>
<li><strong>M + Number Key:</strong> Max out a specific stat automatically.</li>
<li><strong>K Key:</strong> Suicide (to restart or change builds quickly).</li>
</ul>

<!-- Evolution System -->
<section id="evolution">
<h2>The Evolution Tree: Choosing Your Class</h2>
<p>Progression occurs at Level 15, 30, and 45. Each choice narrows your specialty:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Twin:</strong> Double the barrels, double the fire rate. Great for bullet spam.</li>
<li><strong>Sniper:</strong> Increased vision and bullet speed. Perfect for long-range kills.</li>
<li><strong>Machine Gun:</strong> High fire rate with high spread. Great for area denial.</li>
<li><strong>Flank Guard:</strong> Barrels on both sides to prevent getting sneaked up on.</li>
<li><strong>Advanced Classes:</strong> Includes the <strong>Overlord</strong> (controls drones), the <strong>Destroyer</strong> (fires massive, slow bullets), and the <strong>Stalker</strong> (becomes invisible when standing still).</li>
</ul>
</section>
<!-- Game Modes -->
<section id="game-modes">
<h2>Game Modes: FFA, Teams, and Domination</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
<p>Diep.io features several ways to play depending on whether you like solo or cooperative action:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>FFA (Free For All):</strong> Every tank for themselves. Trust no one.</li>
<li><strong>2/4 Teams:</strong> Cooperate with your color-coded teammates to push back the enemy.</li>
<li><strong>Domination:</strong> Capture and hold giant "Dominator" turrets to win the game.</li>
<li><strong>Tag:</strong> Kill players on the other team to convert them to your team's color.</li>
<li><strong>Sandbox:</strong> A private room to test out builds and evolutions freely.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</section>
<!-- Strategies -->
<section id="strategies">
<h2>Advanced Strategies: Glass Cannons and Rammers</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Glass Cannon Build:</strong> Max out Bullet Speed, Penetration, Damage, and Reload. You will be fragile, but you'll destroy anything you hit instantly.</li>
<li><strong>The Rammer Build:</strong> Max out Max Health, Body Damage, and Movement Speed. Ignore bullets and try to physically crash into enemies to kill them.</li>
<li><strong>The Pentagon Nest:</strong> Find the center of the map. It contains Blue Pentagons which give the most XP, but it is also the most contested area in the game.</li>
<li><strong>Bullet Shielding:</strong> Use your bullets to destroy incoming enemy bullets. High Penetration is key to winning "bullet duels."</li>
</ul>

<!-- Tips -->
<section id="tips">
<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks: How to Survive Level 45</h2>
<p>Reaching Level 45 is just the beginning. Staying alive at the top requires discipline.</p>
<h3>Don't Ignore Movement Speed</h3>
<p>Even if you have the strongest bullets, you are a sitting duck if you can't dodge. Always put at least 3-4 points into speed.</p>
<h3>Watch the Leader Arrow</h3>
<p>If you aren't the leader, a gray arrow points toward them. If you ARE the leader, be careful—everyone knows exactly where you are.</p>
<h3>The Overlord Secret</h3>
<p>If you play Overlord, use the Right Click to repel your drones. This allows you to attack enemies from two sides at once.</p>
<h3>Level 22 Transition</h3>
<p>Don't always upgrade your class at Level 15. Sometimes staying as a basic tank until Level 22-30 is better for farming before specializing.</p>

<!-- FAQ -->
<section id="faq">
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
<div class="faq">
<h3>1. What is the best tank in Diep.io?</h3>
<p>There is no single "best" tank, but the <strong>Overlord</strong> and <strong>Penta Shot</strong> are widely considered the strongest for high scores in FFA.</p>
<h3>2. How many levels are there?</h3>
<p>The maximum level is 45. At this level, you gain your final evolution and your last stat point.</p>
<h3>3. What does "Penetration" do?</h3>
<p>Bullet Penetration acts like "Bullet Health." It determines how many shapes or enemy bullets your shot can destroy before disappearing.</p>
<h3>4. Can I play with friends?</h3>
<p>Yes! In Team modes, you can often find a "Copy Party Link" option or simply try to join the same server/region at the same time.</p>
