<!-- About -->
<section id="about">
<h2>About Vectaria.io: The Browser Sandbox Revolution</h2>
<p><strong>Vectaria.io</strong> is a massive multiplayer 3D sandbox adventure game that brings the beloved mechanics of Minecraft directly to your web browser. Developed by the creators of Kirka.io, this game offers a seamless, no-download-required experience for building, mining, and socializing.</p>
<p>In the world of Vectaria, players can inhabit a vast, infinite terrain filled with different biomes. Whether you are a lone architect looking to build masterpieces or a competitive survivor ready to engage in PvP combat, Vectaria provides the tools to shape your own destiny in a voxel-based universe.</p>
</section>
<!-- How to Play -->
<section id="how-to-play">
<h2>How to Play: Getting Started in the Voxel World</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
<p>The gameplay of <strong>Vectaria.io</strong> is centered around resource gathering and environmental interaction.</p>
<p><strong>Spawn and Character:</strong> When you first enter, you'll choose one of four characters: Martha, Oliver, Mike, or Rose. You will spawn in a central hub where you can join different game servers.</p>
<p><strong>Mining:</strong> Use your fists or tools to break blocks. Trees provide wood, while digging underground reveals stone, coal, iron, and rare diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>Crafting:</strong> Open your inventory to combine basic materials into advanced tools, weapons, and furniture. A workbench is required for more complex recipes.</p>
</div>
</section>
<!-- Game Modes -->
<section id="modes">
<h2>Game Modes: Peaceful, Survival, and Creative</h2>
<p>Vectaria.io caters to all types of gamers with three distinct primary modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Peaceful Mode:</strong> A safe haven for builders. Hunger is less of a concern, and PvP is disabled. Focus entirely on exploration and large-scale construction.</li>
<li><strong>Survival Mode:</strong> The classic challenge. Manage your health and hunger bars while defending against other players and environmental hazards.</li>
<li><strong>Creative Mode:</strong> Infinite resources at your fingertips. Fly through the world and build anything you can imagine without the need to mine or farm.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<!-- Controls -->
<section id="controls">
<h2>Controls: Navigating and Crafting</h2>
<p>If you have played any first-person sandbox game, the controls in Vectaria.io will feel natural.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WASD / Arrow Keys:</strong> Move your character.</li>
<li><strong>Spacebar:</strong> Jump.</li>
<li><strong>Left Click:</strong> Break blocks or attack enemies.</li>
<li><strong>Right Click:</strong> Place blocks or interact with chests/workbenches.</li>
<li><strong>Mouse Scroll / 1-9:</strong> Switch between items in your hotbar.</li>
<li><strong>X Key:</strong> Open your inventory and crafting menu.</li>
<li><strong>Enter:</strong> Open the chat to talk to other players.</li>
<li><strong>O Key:</strong> Open the shop for skins and accessories.</li>

<!-- Land Protection -->
<section id="protection">
<h2>Land Protection: Using the Ruler Tool</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
<p>One of the most unique features of Vectaria.io is the built-in "Grief Protection" system.</p>
<p>In survival and peaceful modes, you can craft a <strong>Ruler</strong>. By using this tool to mark two corners of a rectangular area, you can "claim" that land. Once claimed, other players cannot break your blocks or open your chests without your permission. This ensures your hard work remains safe while you are offline.</p>
</div>
</section>
<!-- Strategies -->
<section id="strategies">
<h2>Advanced Strategies: Base Building and Trading</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vertical Mining:</strong> Never dig straight down! Always mine in a "staircase" pattern to avoid falling into lava or deep pits.</li>
<li><strong>The Workbench Priority:</strong> Your first 10 minutes should be spent gathering wood to make a workbench and wooden pickaxe. This allows you to skip straight to stone tools, which are much faster.</li>
<li><strong>Market Awareness:</strong> Use the shop and global chat to trade rare materials with other players. Diamonds can often be traded for custom skins or large amounts of basic building blocks.</li>
<li><strong>Biome Hunting:</strong> Different biomes contain different resources. If you need sand for glass, head to the desert; if you need spruce wood, head to the snowy taiga.</li>
</ul>

<!-- Safety Section -->
<section id="safety">
<h2>Is Vectaria.io Safe for Kids?</h2>
<div class="highlight-box">
<p>Parents often wonder if <strong>Vectaria.io</strong> is a suitable alternative to Minecraft for younger players. Generally, the game is considered safe for children ages 7 and up, but there are a few things parents should keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Visual Content:</strong> The game uses "voxel" (blocky) graphics similar to LEGO. There is no graphic violence or blood. When a character is defeated, they simply disappear and respawn.</li>
<li><strong>Online Interaction:</strong> Like all .io games, Vectaria features a live chat. While there are basic filters for profanity, it is an unmoderated space. We recommend that younger children play in "Peaceful Mode" or that parents disable the chat overlay in the settings.</li>
<li><strong>Safety in Peaceful Mode:</strong> For kids who just want to build, <strong>Peaceful Mode</strong> is the best option. It removes the threat of "player-killing" (PvP), allowing children to focus on creativity without the frustration of losing their progress to aggressive players.</li>
<li><strong>Monetization:</strong> The game is supported by advertisements and in-game purchases for skins. These ads are typically for other games and are generally age-appropriate, but they may encourage "impulse clicking."</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Verdict:</strong> With its creative focus and blocky aesthetic, Vectaria.io is a great tool for developing spatial awareness and teamwork, provided parents are aware of the social nature of the game.</p>

<!-- Tips -->
<section id="tips">
<h2>Tips &amp; Tricks: How to Survive Your First Night</h2>
<h3>Keep a Bed Handy</h3>
<p>Crafting a bed is essential. It allows you to set your spawn point. If you die in survival mode without a bed, you might respawn thousands of blocks away from your base.</p>
<h3>Farming for Food</h3>
<p>In Survival mode, don't just rely on hunting. Use a hoe on grass near water to plant seeds. A wheat farm provides a sustainable source of bread.</p>
<h3>Light it Up</h3>
<p>Use torches liberally inside your base. This prevents hostile mobs from spawning in dark corners and gives your base a welcoming glow.</p>
