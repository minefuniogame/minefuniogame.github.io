        <!-- About -->
        <section id="about">
            <h2>About Diep.io: The Evolution of the .io Genre</h2>
            <p>Created by Matheus Valadares in 2016, <strong>Diep.io</strong> took the simple "eat and grow" formula of Agar.io and infused it with RPG-style progression and tactical shooting. Instead of a cell, you control a 2D tank in a massive, destructible arena filled with geometric shapes and hostile players.</p>
            <p>What sets Diep.io apart is its <strong>deep character customization</strong>. Every shape you destroy and every opponent you defeat grants you experience points (XP), allowing you to level up, upgrade your stats, and eventually evolve into dozens of specialized tank classes. It is a game of skill, math, and reflexes.</p>
        </section>

        <!-- How to Play -->
        <section id="how-to-play">
            <h2>How to Play: From Basic Tank to War Machine</h2>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>The journey in <strong>Diep.io</strong> begins as a simple Level 1 Tank. Your primary goal is to destroy "polygons" (shapes) to earn XP and climb to the maximum level of 45.</p>
                <p><strong>Leveling Up:</strong> As you gain XP, your level increases. Every few levels, you earn a <strong>Stat Point</strong> which can be invested into eight different attributes. At levels 15, 30, and 45, you are given the option to evolve into a new, more powerful tank class.</p>
                <p><strong>Combat:</strong> You must balance farming shapes with defending yourself from other players. The arena is a constant "bullet hell" environment where positioning is just as important as your firepower.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <!-- Upgrade Tree -->
        <section id="upgrade-tree">
            <h2>The Upgrade Tree: Choosing Your Evolution</h2>
            <p>The evolution system is the heart of Diep.io strategy. Depending on your playstyle, you can choose different paths:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Level 15:</strong> Choose between the Twin (more bullets), Sniper (range/vision), Machine Gun (fire rate), or Flank Guard (rear protection).</li>
                <li><strong>Level 30:</strong> Each path branches further. For example, the Sniper can become an Assassin or an Overseer (controlling drones).</li>
                <li><strong>Level 45:</strong> The final evolution. This is where you unlock legendary tanks like the <strong>Overlord</strong>, <strong>Pentashot</strong>, <strong>Hybrid</strong>, or the stealthy <strong>Stalker</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Controls -->
        <section id="controls">
            <h2>Controls: Precise Aiming and Tactical Movement</h2>
            <p>Diep.io uses a hybrid control system that requires coordination between both hands.</p>
            <p><strong>Desktop:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>WASD or Arrow Keys:</strong> Move your tank across the grid.</li>
                <li><strong>Mouse Move:</strong> Aim your tank's turrets.</li>
                <li><strong>Left Click or Spacebar:</strong> Fire your weapon.</li>
                <li><strong>E Key:</strong> Toggle Auto-fire (extremely useful for farming).</li>
                <li><strong>C Key:</strong> Toggle Auto-spin (mostly used for social interaction or specific builds).</li>
                <li><strong>Number Keys (1-8):</strong> Quick-upgrade stats.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Stats -->
        <section id="stats">
            <h2>Stat Points: Building the Perfect Combatant</h2>
            <p>There are 8 stats you can upgrade. How you distribute your points determines your "build":</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Health Regen:</strong> How fast you recover health after not taking damage.</li>
                <li><strong>Max Health:</strong> The total amount of damage you can soak up.</li>
                <li><strong>Body Damage:</strong> Damage dealt when you physically ram into an object or player.</li>
                <li><strong>Bullet Speed:</strong> How fast your projectiles travel.</li>
                <li><strong>Bullet Penetration:</strong> How many objects a bullet can pass through before disappearing.</li>
                <li><strong>Bullet Damage:</strong> How much health an enemy loses per hit.</li>
                <li><strong>Reload:</strong> Your rate of fire.</li>
                <li><strong>Movement Speed:</strong> How fast your tank moves.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <!-- Shapes -->
        <section id="shapes">
            <h2>The Shapes: Farming Polygons for XP</h2>
            <p>The arena is filled with passive shapes that act as your primary source of XP:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Yellow Squares:</strong> The most common, providing minimal XP.</li>
                <li><strong>Red Triangles:</strong> Slightly tougher and more rewarding.</li>
                <li><strong>Blue Pentagons:</strong> Found mostly in the center of the map ("The Nest"). They give high XP but are often guarded by <strong>Crashers</strong> (small, aggressive pink triangles).</li>
                <li><strong>Alpha Pentagons:</strong> Massive blue shapes with huge health pools. Destroying one can skyrocket your level.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Strategies -->
        <section id="strategies">
            <h2>Advanced Strategies: Glass Cannons vs. Rammers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Glass Cannon:</strong> Maxing out all Bullet stats and Movement Speed, but leaving Health at zero. You are incredibly powerful but will die in one or two hits.</li>
                <li><strong>The Rammer:</strong> Maxing out Max Health, Body Damage, and Movement Speed. You don't shoot to kill; you use your tank as a high-speed projectile to smash into enemies.</li>
                <li><strong>The Drone Master:</strong> Using classes like the Overlord to control AI-driven minions. This requires "micro-management" to lure enemies into a trap.</li>
                <li><strong>Ghosting:</strong> Using the Stalker or Manager classes to turn invisible while standing still, setting up deadly ambushes for unsuspecting players.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- FAQ -->
        <section id="faq">
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
            <div class="faq">
                <h3>1. What is the best tank in Diep.io?</h3>
                <p>There is no single "best" tank, as the game uses a rock-paper-scissors balance. However, the <strong>Overlord</strong> and <strong>Penta Shot</strong> are widely considered the most versatile for high scores.</p>
                <h3>2. How do I turn invisible?</h3>
                <p>You must reach Level 45 and choose the <strong>Stalker</strong>, <strong>Manager</strong>, or <strong>Landmine</strong> classes. Simply stop moving (and stop firing) to fade away.</p>
                <h3>3. What are "Green Shapes"?</h3>
                <p>Green shapes are incredibly rare variants of standard polygons. They grant massive amounts of XP and are considered a "holy grail" for Diep.io players.</p>
                <h3>4. How do I deal with lag?</h3>
                <p>Try disabling "Heavy Lighting" in the settings and ensure you are playing on a server closest to your physical location (e.g., US East, EU, etc.).</p>
